Type of Machine learning on the basis of how ml model trained in production 
what is production?
ans:It is a  Server on which our code is going to run ip address of the server is on the hands of the customers on which by hitting user can access it 
development environment is time at which we are developing the product or wrriting codes 

ML behaves differently in server on the basis of which we are going to see the types of ML
  => Batch Machine Learning vs Online ML

                                                                        Batch learning/ offline ml

Batch learning is a conventional way of training our Machine learning model where we use all the data at a time to train the ml model there is no incremental  training that means training does not happen in parts
in this we train the model ofline at onec and then we put it on the main project 

                                                                        problem with batch learning
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        
out model became static cause of one time training data  it cant learn new things but the scenerio is our buisines model keep evolving 
Retrain is required in this time to time we train it and again put it on the server this became circle

                                                                        Disadvantage of Batch learning
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Lots of Data our data converts into big data
2) Hardware Limitation without connectivity we can't train our model here our app or batch learning fails
3)Availability
