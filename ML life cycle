                                                                100 days of machine learning #day-9

In software engineering there is sdlc how the software is developed is mentioned here in Ml there is MLDLC that is important to create end to end project 
there is 9 to 10 steps 
1) Frame the problem :
  Deside the ps you are working for the company which kind of alo you use is it supervised or unsupervised
2) Gathering the data:
  data can be gathered by api or by webscraping the data is in the form of csv we create data wherehouse 
3) Data preprocessing:
  removing mising value , scale the values, this is standerdization remove empty
4) Exploratory Data Analysis:
  finding the relationship by vizualization we do multivarieat analysis we balance the imbalanced dataset
5) Feature engineering and output:
  we create new feature by selecting two features unwanted feature can be reduced input column ko change krna
6) Model Training evaluation and selection:
   we use performance matrix in the basis of which we find which model is better
   classification have accuracy in regresion have mean square etc.
   ensemble learning is there
7) Model Deployment :
8) Testing: 
9) Optimize:
