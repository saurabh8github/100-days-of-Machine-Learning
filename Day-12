To create an new virtual environment in anaconda go to anaconda prompt and type the following command:

  -> conda create --name your_environment_name_here 

then press enter type Y and press enter

to activate the environment follow the command:

 -> conda activate your_environment_name

now you can see the environment in the anaconda avigator inside this you will find nothing cause we have to install everything we want in particular project 

to install jupyter on the environment you can use the following command:

  ->conda install -c anaconda jupyter

to open the jupyter note book you can run the command:

  ->jupyter notebook 

to install pakages in this project you can go on the command prompt and closs the jupyeter by ctr+c and enter
then use command 
  -> conda install package_name

or you can simply  go on jupyter notebook and type

  ->!pip install package_name

to get out from the environment you can use:
  ->deactivate
to remove the environment use command:
  ->conda remove --name name_of_environment --all

instead of doing this you can also use kaggel for wide data as well to run projects 
we can also use google colab these are nothing but same as jupyter 
to download the data in google colab you can use

create an api of kaggle by your profile it will give json file upload it in google colab then run the following

!mkdir -p ~/kaggle
!cp kagle.json ~/.kaggle/

after this just copy the api path of data set you want to import download
!data_set_api_path
