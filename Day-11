                                                                              100 Days of Machine Learning #day-11
*Tensor :
  It is a Datastructure way of storing data every leaading librares scikit learn are dealing with tensors. number library of google is tensorflow 
  it is a like container for numbers we have already used it gues what vecter matrix etc. are tensor when it is of 0 dimensition then it is scaler list of number is vectors when it is in 2d then it is matrix 
  if the numbere is in 3d or 4d then it is called tensors.

*0D Tensors:
      scaller they have no dimentions like 1 
**Note: Tensors and the n'D array are the same things #

*1D Tensor/ Vector:
      [1,2,3,4,5 ] #1D array ndim=1

Axis: number of dimentions if our tensor has 2 dimention that means it has 2 axis number of axis are called rank 

  ->[1,2] this is an 1d tensor and vector also but the dimention of the vector is 2
  ->if we add scaller into scaller then the vector is created
  ->vector is collection of scallars 
  ->matrix is a collection of vecors

*2D Tesors:
    [1,2,3] [4,5,6] [7,8,9] these are vecors and if we combine them then it is matrix

Rank, Axis, Shape 
    ->no of axis = Rank = no of dimentions
    ->shape is like  (3X3)
    ->size is like how many items are there in the matrix


example of 1d tensor:

students(1000)
cgpa | iq | state | placement
8.5  | 90 | cg    | 1  -> this is my 1D tensor having only 1 axis but it is 3d vector  cause it hase 3 axis cgpa, iq, state

so in above example every students data is a vector and the collection of these vector creats matrix
it is generaly denoted by D in ml

#3d Tensors
  example : in nlp 
      hi nitish
      hi rahul
      hi jitesh

hi | nitish | rahul | jitesh
1  |    0   |    0  |  0
0  |    1   |   0   |  0
0  |    0   |    1  |  0
0  |    0   |    0  |  1

[[[1,0,0,0], [0,1,0,0]]
[[1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,1]]
[[1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,1]]]

this is 3d tensor  with (3,2,4) 
one more example of 3d tensor is time sereis based data it is a collection of 10 - 2d tensors 

#4d tensors:
      images are the example of 4d tensor  batches of image 
#5d tensors:
      videos are the example of 5d tensors collection of frames
