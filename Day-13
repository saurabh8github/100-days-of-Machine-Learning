          #steps:
          #0. Preprocess + EDA + Feature Selection
          #1. extract input adn output cols
          #2. Scale and values
          #3. Train test split
          #4. Train the model
          #5. evaluate the model / model selection
          #6. deploy the model
this things are all in google colab file carefull run that project on your pc or laptop
