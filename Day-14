                                                    100 Days of Machine Learing #day-14


Framing a Machine learning Model 
    planning the problem end to end or converting a buisiness problem into ML problem

1) Business Problem to ML Problem
  let's say there is meeting of netflix you are a data scientist head they asked you how can we increase the revenue of netflix solution:
      ->bring new customer through marketing 
      -> charge more to existing customer
      -> existing customer who are living engage them more 

Churn Rate how many customers are living the platform  decreasing the churn rate will be greate
if churn rate is high then it can be effect the company growth netflix have 4% of churn rate  
this is my first step convert the problem in math form

2) Type of problem
  we have to see the big picture it can be many thing what is my end roduct we dont have to predict churn rate we have to decrease it so 
  first we have to identify the customer who are going to leave the platform 
  let's say i have identified the person now how to hold him on the plateform 
      givfe him discount , identify the problem of the user, 

this is look like supervised and classification problem right no this is regretion pronblem why we havve to know the how many user are planning to leave and how much % chances are there that they were leaving 
according to that we will give them discount abviously giving same persent of discount make compny a bigg loss.

3)Current solution
  there are alreade wroking solution we can get help from there
4)Getting Data
  watch time, search but did not find, content left in the middle, clicked on recommendation etc 
5) Matrix to measure
     need to define the matrix that the things we are doing is right or wrong the prediction are true or not 
6) online or batch? 
7) check your assumptions
    the factor which we looking are available or not  netflix is multilenious plateform may be other countries people thinking of entertainment would be different
